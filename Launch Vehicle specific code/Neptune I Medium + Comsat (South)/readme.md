Place ALL scripts here in KSPROOT/Saves/Scripts
Place the .craft file in the Ships folder.
This script will launch a Earth Communications Satellite into the correct orbit, deploy the solar panels and antenna (They need to be targeted manually) and will also coast to apoapsis(about 6 hours) to complete a small correction to raise periapsis, which it will also do automatically
This is the SOUTH version of the script, the craft with pitch south during accent.
Press 9 to open the kos window.
Run the commands:
switch to archive.
run neptune.

Use AG2 and 3 to swap between on-board camera.
DO NOT PRESS AG1, this will open up all the dishes and solar panels and can not be undone.

This still WIP, the SRB's seperate a little too early and it goes too fast too soon and heats up quite a lot.
